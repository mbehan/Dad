I'm making this package for my 11 year old son who is just starting to learn some programming. There are certain aspects of the Swift language that are distracting for the programming novice but are hard to avoid so I'm creating some functions to delay their appearance until we're ready.

We're beginning with creating command line applications so I expect to add helper methods to make that a bit easier.

The first example of something to hide was the optional returned by the readLine function. It will almost never be nil so crashing when it is is preferrable than dealing with the complexities of nil right now.
